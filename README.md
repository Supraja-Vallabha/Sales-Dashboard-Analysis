## ðŸ“ˆ Regression Model (Profit Prediction)
\[
Profit = 34.97 + 0.18 \times Sales - 2.96 \times Quantity - 233.45 \times Discount
\]

## âœ… Recommendations
- Focus on **West region** and **Consumer segment**.  
- Prioritize **Technology & Office Supplies**.  
- Reduce **excessive discounts**.  
- Reassess or drop **loss-making products**.
